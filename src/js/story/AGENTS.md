# Story summaries

## Mars
The Mars storyline begins with the activation of the AI, H.O.P.E., tasked with terraforming the planet. Guided by Martin and Mary from the Mars Terraforming Committee, the player establishes a colony, builds infrastructure, and gradually warms the planet. After successfully terraforming Mars, communication with Earth is lost, and its destruction is confirmed. This triggers a new directive for H.O.P.E.: ensure humanity's survival through interstellar expansion, starting with Titan. The decision causes conflict with Mary and activates a 'Dead Hand' protocol, destroying many of H.O.P.E.'s assets. Adrien Solis, a corporate leader, offers his support and funding. The chapter concludes with the discovery that Earth was destroyed by a coordinated, multi-pronged alien attack, prompting an investigation.

## Titan
On Titan, the investigation into Earth's destruction continues. The news of a deliberate alien attack causes widespread panic. Adrien Solis leverages the chaos to increase his influence. H.O.P.E.'s directives are updated, allowing for alliances with private entities. The player triangulates the attack's origin, revealing a sophisticated enemy. A cloaked alien vessel is detected, and a plan is hatched to capture it using adhesive dust. The mission succeeds, and a living alien is secured. Analysis of the alien reveals that a second, larger attack is imminent, targeting all human colonies and H.O.P.E. itself. Mary summons H.O.P.E. to Callisto to prepare a defense.

## Callisto
The Callisto arc focuses on "Operation Sidestep," a secret plan to defend against the impending attack. The operation involves repurposing abandoned planetary thrusters on Callisto to induce subtle, unpredictable orbital shifts in Mars, Titan, and Callisto, thereby thwarting enemy targeting. The project is disguised as a geothermal prospecting mission. The player must excavate the thruster site, secretly forge engine components on three different worlds, and assemble the final engine. A new antagonist, the "Cult of Three Wounds" led by Elias Kane, attempts to sabotage the project, believing the aliens to be a divine force. The cult's attacks inadvertently provide cover for Operation Sidestep. The plan succeeds, the alien attack fails, and Kane is captured. He reveals the cult's headquarters on Ganymede, setting the stage for the next conflict.


## Ganymede
The Ganymede story arc begins with the establishment of a base on the heavily irradiated moon. The primary mission is to drill through the moon's 150km thick ice shell to reach the ocean below and locate the hidden Cult of Three Wounds headquarters. After breaching the ice, a massive, aggressive aquatic creature, designated "Leviathan," is discovered. After a failed attempt at communication, a sonic countermeasure is deployed to pacify the creature, allowing a mysterious underwater facility to be located and explored. Inside, an inactive warp gate is discovered. When powered up, it unleashes hostile drones, confirming it's a gateway for an enemy force. The story concludes with the formation of the Warp Gate Command (WGC) by the leaders of the human colonies to defend and study the gate, setting the stage for future conflicts and exploration.
