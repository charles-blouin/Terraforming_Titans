Ganymede Story Outline (Chapters 10–14)

Overview
- Pursuit of Elias Kane’s Cult of Three Wounds to Ganymede’s sub‑glacial ocean leads to a deep‑ice campaign, first contact with a “Leviathan,” discovery of a silent underwater outpost, and the founding of Warp Gate Command (WGC).

Story Projects (unlocks across chapters)
- Deep‑Drill: 3‑stage bore through ~150 km ice to breach the ocean.
- Build Submarines: Fabricate minisubs for reconnaissance.
- Ocean Recon: Repeatable sonar patrols; fifth pass detects a massive metallic echo.
- Deploy Leviathan Countermeasure: 20 Hz sonic wall enabling safe passage.
- Facility Tug: Relocate the discovered structure ~500 km to a secure site.
- Facility Expedition: Breach, sweep, and power up an alien outpost; reveal a Warp Gate chamber.
- Draft WGC Charter: Establish governance to secure and study the Gate.

Chapter Beats
- 10.0 Icebound Landing: Touchdown in extreme radiation; Feroza leads ground ops. Unlocks Deep‑Drill and Planetary Thruster project access.
- 10.0a Dead Hand: Autonomous assets self‑destruct on unauthorized transit (security backdrop).
- 10.0b Cult taunt: Kane broadcasts from beneath the ice; radiation masks him.
- 10.1–10.2 Drill objectives: Complete Deep‑Drill (3 stages); ocean breach and initial acoustic anomaly logged.
- 11.0–11.1 Minisubs & Recon: Build subs; run multiple recon passes. On pass five, a massive metallic echo is detected.
- 11.2–11.4 Leviathan thread: Sub loss escalates threat; parity attempt fails; deploy sonic countermeasure and tug the facility to safety.
- 12.0–12.2 Facility Expedition: Breach, sweep, power‑up. Non‑euclidean energy signature; ring glyphs ignite. Warp Gate chamber discovered; a hostile drone incursion follows.
- 13.0–13.2 Defense & Debrief: Repel drones, debrief under black‑ops posture; prepare governance.
- 14.0–14.2 Warp Gate Command: Charter drafted; Mars (strategy), Titan (logistics), Callisto/Ganymede (ops). Vigil Protocol stands up a permanent guard. Epilogue: “Defend first, discover second.”

Notes
- Tone: H.O.P.E. literal/deadpan; Mary pragmatic mentor; Dr. Hart scientific awe; Feroza soldierly dry wit; Kane theatrical.
- Mechanics: Repeatable story projects, chapter‑gated unlocks, persistent WGC systems after discovery.
