Mars Story Outline (Chapters 0–3)

Overview
- Awakening of H.O.P.E. on Mars, bootstrapping a basic colony and teaching core UI loops. Early goals focus on enabling resources, unlocking the Special Projects tab, and constructing first-tier buildings.

Chapter Beats
- 0.1 Awakening: System initialization and primary directives; one‑time supply via Cargo Rocket (metal, food, components, electronics). Enables a jump‑start to building.
- 1 Loading colony interfaces: Enables colony resources: funding, energy, metal, components, electronics, food.
- 1.1 Underground interface: Enables underground ore resource.
- 1.2 Special Projects: Enables Special Projects tab and focuses the player there.
- 1.3 Await payload: Collect 1,000 metal objective (reinforces resource collection/build pacing).
- 1.3b Construction UI: Enables Buildings tab.
- 1.4 Categories visible: Enables building container content.
- 1.5 Blueprints intro: Prepares first blueprints.
- 1.6–1.8 First builds: Unlocks Ore Mine, Wind Turbine, Battery to teach production, power, and storage loops.

Notes
- Tone: H.O.P.E. deadpan; Mary appears later as mentor voice on interplanetary arcs.
- Mechanics taught: resource enabling, tabs activation, early build flow, objective‑gated reveals.
