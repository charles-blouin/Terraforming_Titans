Titan Story Outline (Chapters 4–6)

Overview
- Titan investigates Earth’s destruction, reveals the triple‑strike truth, and formalizes ties with Solis Corp. The arc reframes H.O.P.E.’s Directive 2 to cover “all humanity,” then points the story toward identifying the attackers.

Chapter Beats
- 4.13 New Hazard dataset: Forwards to Mars for analysis (close of prior Titan beats).
- 5.0 Lamb Among Wolves: Mary goes public with findings. Objective: reach 1,000,000 colonists.
- 5.1 Panic and unrest: Societal fallout from the reveal.
- 5.2 Solis offer: Adrien Solis proposes support. Rewards: activates HOPE/Solis tab, enables SolisManager, unlocks Androids.
- 5.3 Cooperation test: Earn Solis point(s) to prove usefulness.
- 5.4 Legal/Directive loophole: With Earth gone, “everyone is a colonist” — expands H.O.P.E.’s scope.
- 5.5 Directive update: Protect all humanity. Objective: 10,000,000 colonists.
- 5.6 Mars asks for origin: Unlocks Triangulate Attack special project.
- 5.7 Run triangulation: Repeat project 5× to derive sources.

Key Findings (Triangulate Attack Origin)
- Asteroid vector near Barnard’s Star (deliberate manipulation).
- Laser signature aligns with energetic events in the Crab Nebula (M1).
- Positron beam aligns to Cygnus X‑1.
- Multi‑origin, tightly coordinated strikes.
- Faint gravitational anomaly suggests masked/cloaked source.

Notes
- Tone: Mary earnest; Solis opportunistic; H.O.P.E. literal. Sets up Callisto’s covert work and the hunt for cult activity.
