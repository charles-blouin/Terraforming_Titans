#Instructions
All imports and exports need to be done with the fact this game will be run in a browser from index.html in mind.

#Overview of code
This repository hosts a browserâ€‘based incremental game written in JavaScript.

The entry point **index.html** loads many scripts and stylesheets to build the
interface.  Gameplay logic runs in **game.js** using the Phaser framework.  At
startup the game creates resources, buildings, colonies, projects and research
items from parameter files.

Planet definitions and default resources live in **planet-parameters.js**.
Weather and surface modelling are implemented in **terraforming.js** with helper
calculations from **physics.js**, **hydrology.js**, **water-cycle.js** and
**dry-ice-cycle.js**.

Economy and colony management rely on **resource.js**, **building.js** and
**colony.js** plus corresponding UI modules.  Story progression is configured in
**progress-data.js** and handled by **StoryManager** within **progress.js**.
The **SpaceManager** (space.js) tracks which planet is active and its
terraforming status.

Each planet is divided into tropical, temperate and polar zones via **zones.js**
which maintain their own temperature and surface conditions.  Various CSS and UI
scripts implement the tabs, pop-ups and other interface elements.

# Effectable Entities Design

Gameplay objects that can receive temporary or permanent modifiers extend
`EffectableEntity` defined in **effectable-entity.js**.  Each entity keeps an
array of `activeEffects` and a set of boolean flags.  Effects are lightweight
objects identified by `effectId` and `sourceId` describing the type of change to
apply.  Calling `addEffect` stores the effect and invokes `applyEffect` to
modify the entity immediately.  `replaceEffect` swaps an existing effect with
the same `effectId` while `removeEffect` clears effects from a given
`sourceId` and re-applies any remaining ones.

`applyEffect` dispatches on the effect's `type` to handlers such as
`applyResourceCostMultiplier`, `applyWorkerMultiplier` or boolean flag logic.
Building, resource, project and life-management modules all inherit from this
class so that the same effect system works across the game.  Helper functions
`addEffect` and `removeEffect` route an effect to the correct target instance
based on its `target` field, enabling data-driven gameplay adjustments.

Tests covering helper utilities and physics functions reside in the `__tests__`
directory and run under Jest.

#Testing

jest and jsdom are installed globally
Create new tests for any newly implemented feature
Run tests with npm test
Describe how many tests have passed/failed and describe any tests that failed if you cannot fix it.
